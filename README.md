# Embedded-Sentry
#Use the data collected from a single accelerometer and/or magnetometer to record a hand movement sequence as a means to generally “unlock” a resource.
#Recorded sequence must be saved on the microcontroller, using a “Record Key”
feature.
#User then must replicate the key sequence within sufficient tolerances to unlock
the resource.
#A successful unlock must be indicated by a visual indication, such as an LED or
similar indicator.

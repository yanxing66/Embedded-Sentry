#Real_Time_Embeded _System
---------------embebed_sentry---------
Use the data collected from a single accelerometer and/or magnetometer to record a hand movement sequence as a means to generally “unlock” a resource.

•	Designed an intelligent lock, which uses combination of user’s gestures as the password 
•	Established connection between accelerometer and microcontroller. Wrote a program in Arduino to process dimensional data received from accelerometer to identify user gestures
